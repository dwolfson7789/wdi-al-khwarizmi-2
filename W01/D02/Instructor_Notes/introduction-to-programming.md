# computer science

not about ~~computers~~ or ~~science~~

>Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

The word “algorithm” is derived from the Latinization of his name, and the word "algebra" is derived from the Latinization of "al-jabr", part of the title of his most famous book, in which he introduced the fundamental algebraic methods and techniques for solving equations.


# what are computers?


- machines that process a sequence of data 
- they speak binary, we communicate to the machine via an `interpreter`.
- we cast spells with our programs to make the computer do things we want.

# what are they made of?

composed of 

- cpu
- memory  
- persistent storage
- some input(mouse, keyboard, microphone) 
- output(display, vibration motor).

### cpu

- processes the operations we program to solve our problems

- fetches, decodes, executes, and stores.

### memory

stores values

### input

can be a human interface or could be a sensor

### output

storage, display, printer

# programs

set of procedures on `how to` or solve a problem. (imperative vs declartive)

# programming language(s)

- javascript, ruby 
- high-level, dynamically typed


# environment(s)

- chrome and v8
- the virtual machine
- the interpreter
- operating system

# software design

- design is not just what it looks like. design is how it works.
- requirements -> design -> coding -> testing -> deployment
- algorithms

- computation: 

> The traveling salesman problem asks: Given a collection of cities connected by highways, what is the shortest route that visits every city and returns to the starting place? The answer has practical applications to processes such as drilling holes in circuit boards, scheduling tasks on a computer and ordering features of a genome.
