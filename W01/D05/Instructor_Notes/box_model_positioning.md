## Define elements of standard layout and why they don't work on the web
1. standard elements of layout
	- photoshop
		- dimension/position
1. Why can't we simply use dimension and position in layout?
	- a web page needs to be dynamic

## Diagram the box model
1. height/width
1. padding
1. border
1. margin
1. position

## List and define the different ways to display an element
1. block
1. inline
	- ignores width and height properties
	- only horizontal margin and padding are respected
1. inline-block
	- height, width, and vertical padding/margin work

## Differentiate between units of measure in layout
1. px
1. em
1. rem
1. %
	- height: % of parent's height
	- width: % of parent's width
	- padding: % of parents's width
	- border: doesn't even work
	- margin: like padding
	- position: works as expected

## List the different ways an element can be positioned
1. static
1. relative
1. absolute
	- z-indexing
	- absolute within relative
1. fixed
