## REACT FINALE

This is your final chance to build out your React-ionary knowledge before we all explode into Project 3!

### RECIPES (YES, AGAIN)

Rip your entire recipes app (or at least, the frontend) to shreds and rebuild it, using your current knowledge of React best practices. You can even start from scratch. (In fact, I **STRONGLY** advise you do so!) You should:

* incorporate React Router to implement front-end routing in your app so that only the appropriate component is displayed. E.g., your recipes list, an edit component, a new recipe component, etc.

* use ES6 best practices throughout to the extent that you can:
  - `let` and `const` vs. `var`
  - `() => {}` vs. `function() {}`
  - `import` and `export` vs. Node's `require` and `module.exports`


* use JS-based styling throughout. You'll want your Project 3 to have nice styling so you can highlight it on your portfolio! You can always finalize that after the course, but do your best to make this actually look like a modern web app.

* BONUS: Add in additional features. Maybe:
  - Display a list of all recipes by a single author
  - Display all recipes that contain a selected ingredient (i.e., search recipes by ingredient)
  - Harder: Give the user the ability to enter multiple ingredients and display only recipes that contain ALL of them!
  - Display all recipes of a given difficulty level
  - ?? (if you implement something else, Slack it to Ethan to see!)
