## Let's keep React-ing

I've made a mock data file in this directory; this is what was returned from the API after
we made a GET request to get all the babbls. **WE ARE JUST CREATING A UI THIS WEEKEND -- NO BACKEND.**

I would like you to build a static web page using React that does the following:

* Has some header info at the top (like previously)

* Shows all the babbls

* (LITTLE) BONUS: instead of just the babbl author and content displaying, also include "Edit" and "Delete" links (that don't do anything for now) with each babbl.

* BIG, BIG BONUS: only shows the babbls after a click on a 'show all babbls' button (see Liza's example of the counter that iterates up and down for some help here... Also Syed's `nyc-health-battle` demo that he pushed out in Friday's Instructor Notes directory has an example of buttons and logic.)

* Display a form for creating a babbl

* BIG BONUS: only show the form after a click on a 'Create new babbl' button

* Style it out!

* Use ES6 when possible. i.e., `import`, `export`, `let` and `const`.
