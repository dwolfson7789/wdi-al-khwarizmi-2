# WELCOME TO THE WDI-AL-KHWARIZMI student repository!

=================

### General Structure
* Guides & Resources //self-explanatory 
* W01 through W12 //directories for each week of the class. Inside each week's directory you'll find:
  * D01 through D05 //directories for each day. Each day in turn contains:
    * Assignments
      * Morning_Exercise //files for the morning warmups
      * Lab //files for the afternoon lab
      * Homework //files for, you guessed it, homework
    * Instructor_Notes //lesson plans, etc.
* PROJECTS //Information relating to each of the required class projects

### HOMEWORK SUBMISSION
These instructions are included in the first two homeworks. After that, it's assumed you know how to find it here if you need to refer to the process.

In order to submit homeworks, you must have:
Forked the class repo (found [here](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-al-Khwarizmi)) on Github to your personal Github.
Cloned that remote repo from your Github to your local machine. If you haven't yet, do this now!
To submit a homework, you must first commit your changes. In the Terminal, in the directory where you're working (generally that day's directory):

```
git add -A
git commit -m "some sort of commit message, i.e., 'working on homework. Ethan sucks'"
```

This saves the changes to your local repo on your machine. You now need to push those changes out to your remote repo on Github: `git push origin master`

When you've completed the homework (or gotten as far as you're going to), go to your Github account and navigate to the folder where the homework (the URL will look something like https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/wdi-al-Khwarizmi/tree/master/W01/D02/Assignments/Homework). Copy this URL to the clipboard.

Now go to our main class repo (again, [here it is](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-al-Khwarizmi)). (TIP: bookmark both the class repo and your personal fork -- you'll be accessing them both constantly.) Click on the 'Issues' tab and create a new Issue:

Title: [Your name] Homework Week#Day# (e.g., Ethan Friedman HW W01D04)
Body: In the body of the issue, paste the link to the homework's location, the one you just copied.
Include also, on a scale of 1-5:
How complete you feel your HW submission is
How comfortable you felt with the HW
Also include:
Wins: What are you feeling good about in the topics covered in the HW?
Struggles: What are you struggling with?
Comments: Anything else you'd like to add? When you're done, submit the issue. Your homework is in!
