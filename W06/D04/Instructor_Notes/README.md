# Objectives
- Write and read JSON files that store some sort of information.
- create a backend express server that listens to requests and responds accordingly
- write callbacks for POST and GET http that write data and retrieve data (respetively)
- setup a very bare bones front-end that will talk to our back-end.
- Describe cors, bodyparser and npm init.

Introduction:

Today we're looking how we can roll our own API. We will be adding the ability
to save work and display it. We'll also talk to our back-end the same
way we were talking to other APIs (via ajax)
