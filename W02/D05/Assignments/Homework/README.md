# Two weeks down!

Pat yourselves on the back -- you've earned it.

There's two parts to the weekend's homework. **DON'T LEAVE THIS HOMEWORK UNTIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON IF YOU CAN!** This is a lot smaller than last weekend's HW, but still -- this is a bigger homework than on a weeknight since you have three nights to do it.

## Part 1: Supply

Head over to the supply directory. Recreate the mockup shown. All the needed image files are in the img directory. Here's the trick: Build it ***twice***. Once using a traditional CSS grid (applying row and column classes as needed as Liza showed us in class). And once using flexbox.
#### BONUS
Make your design responsive using media queries. Change the design as needed: maybe all the images take up the full width of the screen on a mobile-size screen.

## Part 2: Haunted Mansion Speech-Recognition Game!
You'll find everything you need in the Haunted_Mansion directory. Just like with the Memory game, I've scaffolded everything -- you'll need to build the logic to make the game work.
#### BONUS
If you get everything working you'll notice there's an assets/audio directory with a couple of spooky sounds in it. Try playing around with getting the sounds to display in the browser (you'll need an audio tag with a src attribute set to the appropriate file) at different points in the game.
Try playing with styling too.
