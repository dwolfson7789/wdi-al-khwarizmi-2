# Objectives

- Using floats for layouts

# introduction

We've looked at how we can position elements through the css position property.
No we're going to look at yet another way to layout our page. It's called
the float

Floats have some interesting properties to them:

> Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage, like when the text box in the print layout was told to ignore the page wrap. Absolutely positioned page elements will not affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect them, whether they touch each other or not.

> Originally Designed to allow content to wrap around images.
