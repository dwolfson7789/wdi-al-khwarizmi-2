# Take the Money and Run!

**Do Not Touch Anything in the `body` tag.** You are only allowed to write code inside cashmoney.js.

Note that all styling is inline (bad form!) inside index.html.

## Write some JS to do the following

- When the first link on the page is clicked, the background color should change to something that is **not** white, blue, or black.

- When the second through fifth links are clicked, the relevant part of the song should be displayed. (HINT: Notice that the `href` of the third link isn't `#`. Maybe some kind of **default** action should be **prevented**...)

## BONUS!
- When the last link is clicked, one line of the chorus should be displayed. Each subsequent click should display an additional line of the chorus until all 6 lines are displayed.
