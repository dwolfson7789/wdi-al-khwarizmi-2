## Part 1: Snuggles the Cat

Remember Snuggles? I want you to expand out on the Snuggles we did in class on Wednesday. We only made Snuggles move in one direction. Let's make it a little more intense -- use your code from Wednesday as a starter!

## Part 2: Haunted Mansion

If you were stuck on Haunted Mansion over the weekend, check out my code for the function you were stuck on, and see if you can get past that breakpoint.
