// grab the cat from the DOM
// make her move around!
// use a transform to make sure she's facing in the appropriate direction
// try making her jump: she should move both horizontally and vertically, then descend to her
// original horizontal line of movement.
// you could use a transform to make her stretch out while she's jumping, perhaps?
// try making her bounce off all four walls: she should move diagonally until she hits a wall, then
// "bounce" off that wall until she hits another and so on.
// depending on time you could do lots of things! Be creative! If you like what your Snuggles does,
// slack or email a link to me (Ethan) so I can check it out!
