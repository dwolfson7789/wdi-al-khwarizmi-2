# Snuggles the Cat!

See the script.js file -- that's where you'll write your code.

1. Grab the cat from the DOM
1. Make her move around -- we made her move left to right together in class, if you remember. Then we made her bounce off the far wall, bounce off both walls, used a transform so she flipped right-to-left when she was moving back left, and finally made her move up and down instead. Whew!
1. You should extend that. First, recreate what we did on Wednesday. You should have the code from our review session.
1. Then try making her do different things. Make her jump: She should start moving right then at some point, she should move upwards as well to a max height, then return downwards to her original position (so she describes an arc in the air, like a real running jump). Try adding in a transform if you like so that she stretches out mid-air as she jumps.
1. Finally, if you have time, make her bounce off of all four "walls". Start her moving on a diagonal instead of straight up or down. When she hits one of the edges of the window (remember window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight?), she should bounce off it like, say, a ping-pong ball would and move diagonally again.
1. If you've got the above working, for a super bonus try adding in a little randomness to the diagonal movement so that she occasionally changes the slope of her movement -- you've created a Snuggles screensaver!
